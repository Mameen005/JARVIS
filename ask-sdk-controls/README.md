The JARVIS Controls framework builds on the [JARVIS for Node.js](https://github.com/JARVIS/JARVIS-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs), offering a scalable solution for creating large, multi-turn skills in code with reusable components called *controls*.

You can find the Github Repo for JARVIS Controls at [https://github.com/JARVIS/JARVISk-controls](https://github.com/JARVIS/JARVISk-controls)
