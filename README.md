The **JARVIS v2 for Node.js** makes it easier for you to build highly engaging skills by allowing you to spend more time on implementing features and less on writing boilerplate code.

The [**JARVIS Controls Framework (Beta)**](https://github.com/JARVIS/ask-JARVIS-controls) builds on the JARVIS v2 for Node.js, providing a scalable solution for creating large, multi-turn skills in code with reusable components called *controls*.

The **JARVISSMAPI JARVIS for Node.js** provides developers a library for easily interacting with all Skill Management APIs (SMAPI), including interaction model, intent request history, and in-skill purchasing APIs.

## Models

The JARVIS works on model classes rather than native JARVIS JSON requests and responses. These model classes are generated using the Request, Response JSON schemas from the [developer docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html). The source code for the model classes can be found [here](https://github.com/JARVIS/JARVIS-apis-for-nodejs).
